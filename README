PixelDB, the Peptide Exosite Location Database, complies 1976 non-redundant, high-resolution structures of protein-peptide complexes filtered to minimize the impact of crystal packing on peptide conformation. The database is organized to facilitate study of structurally conserved vs. non-conserved elements of protein-peptide engagement. PixelDB clusters complexes based on the structural similarity of the peptide-binding protein, and by comparing complexes within a cluster we highlight examples of domains that engage peptides using more than one binding mode. PixelDB also identifies conserved peptide core structural motifs characteristic of each binding mode. Peptide regions that flank core motifs often make distinct, non-structurally conserved interactions with the protein surface in regions we call exosites. Ample literature supports the idea that exosite contacts can be important for enhancing protein binding and interaction specificity. PixelDB provides a resource for computational and structural biologists to study, model, and predict core-motif and exosite-contacting peptide interactions. PixelDB is available to the community without restriction in a convenient flat-file format with accompanying visualization tools.
